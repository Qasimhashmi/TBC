              I'm using Pretty Progress to track my travels and to remind me to
              appreciate the moment I'm in (because it doesn't last forever). I
              like seeing the widget whenever I'm on my iPad; it's unobtrusive
              and minimal. It doesn't push itself on you - just provides the
              countdown reminder that you set. Good work on this app!
